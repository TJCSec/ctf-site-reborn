					<h3>What is TJCTF?</h3>
					<p>TJCTF is a cybersecurity competition designed for high school students. Challenges will span various difficulty levels, so there will be problems for students who are new to computer science as well as those who are computer security experts. </p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<h3>How do I register?</h3>
					<p>TJCTF is open to all United States high school students. Students will compete on teams of up to five members, and will have just over a week to earn as many points as possible. Register using the form below and invite your friends to compete!</p>
					<p>Registration is closed.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<h3>How does TJCTF work?</h3>
					<p>TJCTF is simple. Your team is given 4 days to solve as many of the ~30 provided challenges as possible. The object of each challenge is to find a short string called the "flag" by solving a computer security puzzle. You'll know when you've found it. Each flag you find earns you points and the teams with the most points win.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-3">
					<h3>How do I prepare?</h3>
					<p>TJCTF has challenges for computer science students with all levels of experience, so preparation shouldn't be necessary, but if you'd like to brush up on computer security to give your team a competitive edge, we've compiled helpful materials for review available at the link below.</p>
